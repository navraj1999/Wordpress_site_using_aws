# Wordpress_site_using_aws
WordPress is a web publishing platform for building blogs and websites. It can be customized via a wide selection of themes, extensions, and plugins. WordPress High Availability by Bitnami installs the WordPress application on multiple servers (Amazon EC2 instances) in the AWS Cloud for high performance and availability. It also sets up an Aurora relational database to help you reduce costs, simplify configuration tasks, and scale with ease. The database and WordPress application are set up on different EC2 instances to help improve security and access control. Optionally, you can deploy an Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached server to cache database queries. You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
